Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I'm very excited to share this space with you where I'll be writing about web development, technology and my experiences as a developer.

## What will you find here?

In this blog I will share:

- **Technical tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on modern web technologies
- **Personal experiences**: Lessons learned in my career as a developer
- **Tool analysis**: Reviews and comparisons of frameworks and libraries
- **Best practices**: Tips and advice for writing better code
- **Personal projects**: Showcases of my most interesting work

## My approach

I firmly believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the community. Each article will be written with the intention of being useful for both beginner and experienced developers.

### Technologies I'm passionate about

I currently work mainly with:

```javascript
const techStack = {
  frontend: ['React', 'Vue.js', 'TypeScript'],
  backend: ['Node.js', 'Python', 'PHP'],
  databases: ['PostgreSQL', 'MongoDB', 'Redis'],
  tools: ['Docker', 'Git', 'AWS']
};
```

## Why Jekyll and GitHub Pages?

I chose Jekyll for this blog for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: Markdown for writing, no complications
2. **Speed**: Super fast static sites
3. **Full control**: Complete customization of the design
4. **Free**: Free hosting with GitHub Pages
5. **Version control**: All content in Git

## Upcoming articles

Stay tuned for upcoming articles where I'll cover:

- Modern development environment setup
- Best practices in React and Vue.js
- API design with Node.js and Express
- Database optimization with PostgreSQL
- Docker deployment and container orchestration
