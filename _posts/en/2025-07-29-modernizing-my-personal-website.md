Hello! Today I want to share with you the modernization process of my personal website that I just completed. I've completely updated the configuration, personalized the content, and improved the user experience.

## Why did I decide to renovate my site?

After some time with placeholder content and generic configurations, it was time to take the step and completely personalize my online presence. A well-maintained personal website is your digital business card, especially in the development world.

## Main improvements implemented

### üé® Complete personalization
- **Real information**: Removed all placeholders and added my personal information
- **Optimized configuration**: Fixed Jekyll configuration for GitHub Pages
- **Updated links**: Connected my real LinkedIn and GitHub profiles

### üöÄ Technical improvements
- **Optimized SEO**: Improved meta tags and semantic structure
- **Responsive design**: The site looks perfect on all devices
- **Performance**: Loading speed optimizations
- **Accessibility**: Implemented accessibility best practices

### üíº Portfolio section
- **Updated CV**: Real experience, education, and skills
- **Featured projects**: Showcase of my best work
- **Certifications**: Professional credentials and achievements

## Technologies used

```yaml
technologies:
  generator: Jekyll
  hosting: GitHub Pages
  styles: CSS3 with CSS variables
  interactivity: JavaScript ES6+
  icons: Font Awesome 6.0
  typography: Google Fonts (Inter)
```

## Lessons learned

### 1. The importance of authentic content
There's nothing like having real content instead of placeholders. This not only improves credibility but also helps with SEO and user experience.

### 2. Correct configuration from the start
Small details like the correct `baseurl` can make the difference between a site that works perfectly and one with broken links.

### 3. Continuous optimization
A website is never "finished". There are always opportunities for improvement and new features to add.

## Next steps

These are the improvements I have planned for the coming weeks:

- [ ] **Contact form**: Implement a functional form
- [ ] **Project gallery**: Dedicated section with screenshots and demos
- [ ] **Analytics**: Integrate Google Analytics for metrics
- [ ] **PWA**: Convert the site into a Progressive Web App
- [ ] **Automated tests**: Implement testing with GitHub Actions
- [ ] **Blog RSS**: Improve feed for subscribers

## Final thoughts

Modernizing my website has been a very rewarding exercise. It not only improves my online presence but also allows me to experiment with new technologies and keep my skills up to date.

If you have a personal website that you haven't updated in a while, I encourage you to dedicate a weekend to it. The results are worth it.

## What do you think?

I'd love to know your opinion about the renovated site. What do you think of the design? Is there any functionality you miss?
